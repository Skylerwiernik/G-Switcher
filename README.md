# G-Switcher
## About
G-Switcher is a Firefox extension that allows a user to easily switch between default Google accounts.
  
This is especially usful for switching between a personal, and school/work account. Often times our personal accounts are /u/0, while we have our school/work account as /u/1 or higher. When working, it's often annoying to have to continuly use Google's UI to switch to your account when going between Gmail, Google Classroom, Google Drive, and other Google services.
  
G-Switcher allows us to change our default Google account with only 1 click. Simply click the extension icon in your browser bar to cycle between accounts. After cycling through all of your accounts, you can click again to disable the extension, and again to reenable it and restart on /u/0.
  
## Instalation
